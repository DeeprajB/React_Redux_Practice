# Redux Concepts and Pattern

## Assignment 1

Make a Async type of call from a new reducer to any online API like [JSON Placeholder Posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts). Also show proper loading message in console. Like - `loading posts...`, `posts loaded` , `posts fetching failed`. Also add those posts to a state of reducer in a sorted manner (sort by `title`)

## Assignment 2
